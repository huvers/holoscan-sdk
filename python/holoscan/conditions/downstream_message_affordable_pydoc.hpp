PYDOC(DownstreamMessageAffordableCondition, R"doc(
Condition that permits execution when the downstream operator can accept new messages.

Satisfied when the receiver queue of any connected downstream operators has at least a certain
number of elements free. The minimum number of messages that permits the execution of
the entity is specified by `min_size`. It can be used for operators to prevent operators from
sending a message when the downstream operator is not ready to receive it.

Parameters
----------
fragment : holoscan.core.Fragment
    The fragment the condition will be associated with
min_size : int
    The minimum number of free slots present in the back buffer.
transmitter : str, optional
    The name of the operator's output port to which the condition would apply.
name : str, optional
    The name of the condition.

Notes
-----
This condition is typically set within the `Operator.setup` method using the `IOSpec.condition`
method with `ConditionType.DOWNSTREAM_MESSAGE_AFFORDABLE`. In that case, the transmitter name is
already known from the port corresponding to the `IOSpec` object, so the "transmitter" argument is
not needed.
)doc")

PYDOC(transmitter, R"doc(
The transmitter associated with the condition.
)doc")

PYDOC(min_size, R"doc(
The minimum number of free slots required for the downstream entity's back
buffer.
