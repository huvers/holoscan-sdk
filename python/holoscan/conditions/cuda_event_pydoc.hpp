Condition class to indicate data availability on CUDA stream completion via an event.

A condition which specifies the availability of data at the receiver on completion of the work on
the provided cuda stream with the help of cuda event. This condition will keep polling on the
event provided to check for data availability for consumption.

Parameters
----------
fragment : holoscan.core.Fragment
    The fragment the condition will be associated with.
event_name : event, optional
    The event name on which the cudaEventQuery API is called to get the status.
receiver : str, optional
    The name of the operator's input port to which the condition would apply.
name : str, optional
    The name of the condition.

Notes
-----
The `nvidia::gxf::CudaEvent` class is currently unused by Holoscan SDK. This condition is
intended exclusively for interoperation with wrapped GXF Codelets that use GXF's CudaEvent type.
