PYDOC(CudaBufferAvailableCondition, R"doc(
Condition based on data availability in a CudaBuffer object.

A component which specifies the availability of data at the receiver based on the CudaBuffers
present in incoming messages.

Parameters

    The fragment the condition will be associated with.
receiver : str, optional
    The name of the operator's input port to which the condition would apply.
name : str, optional
    The name of the condition.

-----
The `nvidia::gxf::CudaBuffer` class is currently unused by Holoscan SDK. This condition is
intended exclusively for interoperation with wrapped GXF Codelets that use GXF's CudaBuffer type.
