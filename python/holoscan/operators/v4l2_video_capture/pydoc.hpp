PYDOC(V4L2VideoCaptureOp, R"doc(
Operator to get a video stream from a V4L2 source.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.9/media/uapi/v4l/v4l2.html

Inputs a video stream from a V4L2 node, including USB cameras and HDMI IN.

 - Input stream is on host. If no pixel format is specified in the yaml configuration file, the
   pixel format will be automatically selected. However, only `AB24`, `YUYV`, `MJPG`, and `RGB3`
   are then supported.
   If a pixel format is specified in the yaml file, then this format will be used. However, note
   if `pass_through` is `false` that the operator then expects that this format can be encoded as
   RGBA32. If not, the behavior is undefined.
 - Output stream is on host. if `pass_through` is `false` (the default) the video buffer is
   converted to RGBA32, else output the input video buffer unmodified.

Use ``holoscan.operators.FormatConverterOp`` to move data from the host to a GPU device.

**==Named Outputs==**

    signal : nvidia::gxf::VideoBuffer
        A message containing a video buffer on the host with format GXF_VIDEO_FORMAT_RGBA.

**==Device Memory Requirements==**

    When using this operator with a ``holoscan.resources.BlockMemoryPool``, a single device memory
    block is needed (``storage_type=1``). The size of this memory block can be determined by
    rounding the width and height up to the nearest even size and then padding the rows as needed
    so that the row stride is a multiple of 256 bytes. C++ code to calculate the block size is as
    follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_block_size(height, width):
        height_even = height + (height & 1)
        width_even = width + (width & 1)
        row_bytes = width_even * 4  # 4 bytes per pixel for 8-bit RGBA
        row_stride = row_bytes if (row_bytes % 256 == 0) else ((row_bytes // 256 + 1) * 256)
        return height_even * row_stride

Parameters
----------
fragment : Fragment (constructor only)
    The fragment that the operator belongs to.
allocator : holoscan.resources.Allocator
    Memory allocator to use for the output.
device : str
    The device to target (e.g. "/dev/video0" for device 0). Default value is ``"/dev/video0"``.
width : int, optional
    Width of the video stream. Default value is ``0``.
height : int, optional
    Height of the video stream. Default value is ``0``.
num_buffers : int, optional
    Number of V4L2 buffers to use. Default value is ``4``.
pixel_format : str
    Video stream pixel format (little endian four character code (fourcc)).
    Default value is ``"auto"``.
pass_through : bool
    If set, pass through the input buffer to the output unmodified, else convert to RGBA32.
    Default value is ``False``.
name : str, optional (constructor only)
    The name of the operator. Default value is ``"v4l2_video_capture"``.
exposure_time : int, optional
    Exposure time of the camera sensor in multiples of 100 Î¼s (e.g. setting exposure_time to 100 is
    10 ms).
    Default: auto exposure, or camera sensor default.
    Use `v4l2-ctl -d /dev/<your_device> -L` for a range of values supported by your device.
    When not set by the user, V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO is set to V4L2_EXPOSURE_AUTO, or to
    V4L2_EXPOSURE_APERTURE_PRIORITY if the former is not supported.
    When set by the user, V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO is set to V4L2_EXPOSURE_SHUTTER_PRIORITY, or to
    V4L2_EXPOSURE_MANUAL if the former is not supported. The provided value is then used to set
    V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_ABSOLUTE.
gain : int, optional
    Gain of the camera sensor.
    Default: auto gain, or camera sensor default.
    Use `v4l2-ctl -d /dev/<your_device> -L` for a range of values supported by your device.
    When not set by the user, V4L2_CID_AUTOGAIN is set to true (if supported).
    When set by the user, V4L2_CID_AUTOGAIN is set to false (if supported). The provided value is
    then used to set V4L2_CID_GAIN.
