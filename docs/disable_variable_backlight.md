# Disabling Variable Backlight

Various monitors have a Variable Backlight feature. That setting can add up to a frame of latency when enabled. Refer to your monitor's manufacturer instructions to disable it.

:::{tip}
To disable variable backlight on the ASUS ROG Swift monitors mentioned above, use the joystick button at the back of the display, go to the `image` tag, select `variable backlight`, then switch that setting to `OFF`.
