# Data Flow Tracking

:::{warning}
Data Flow Tracking is currently not supported between multiple fragments in a [distributed application](./holoscan_create_distributed_app.md).
:::

The Holoscan SDK provides the Data Flow Tracking APIs as a mechanism to profile your application and
analyze the fine-grained timing properties and data flow between operators in the graph of a fragment.

Currently, data flow tracking is only supported between the root operators and leaf operators of a
graph and in simple cycles in a graph (support for tracking data flow between any pair of operators
in a graph is planned for the future).

- A *root operator* is an operator without any predecessor nodes.
- A *leaf operator* (also known as a *sink operator*) is an operator without any successor nodes.

When data flow tracking is enabled, every message is tracked from the root operators to the leaf operators and in cycles. Then, the maximum (worst-case), average, and minimum end-to-end latencies of one or more paths can be retrieved using the Data Flow Tracking APIs.

:::{tip}
- The end-to-end latency between a root operator and a leaf operator is the time taken between the start of a root operator and the end of a leaf operator. Data Flow Tracking enables the support to track the end-to-end latency of every message being passed between a root operator and a leaf operator.
- The reported end-to-end latency for a cyclic path is the time taken between the start of the first operator of a cycle and the time when a message is again received by the first operator of the cycle.
:::

The API also provides the ability to retrieve the number of messages sent from the root operators.

:::{tip}

- The Data Flow Tracking feature is also illustrated in the [flow_tracker](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan/holoscan-sdk/blob/main/examples/flow_tracker)
- Look at the {cpp:class}`C++ <holoscan::DataFlowTracker>` and {py:class}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowTracker>` API documentation for exhaustive definitions

## Enabling Data Flow Tracking

Before an application ({cpp:class}`C++ <holoscan::Application>`/{py:class}`python <holoscan.core.Application>`) is run with the `run()` method,
data flow tracking can be enabled by calling the `track()` method in
{cpp:func}`C++ <holoscan::Fragment::track>` and using the `Tracker` class in
{py:class}`python <holoscan.core.Tracker>`.

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} C++
```{code-block} cpp
:emphasize-lines: 2
:name: holoscan-enable-data-flow-tracking-cpp
auto app = holoscan::make_application<MyPingApp>();
auto& tracker = app->track(); // Enable Data Flow Tracking
// Change tracker and application configurations
...
app->run();
```
````
````{tab-item} Python
```{code-block} python
:emphasize-lines: 2
:name: holoscan-enable-data-flow-tracking-python
from holoscan.core import Tracker
...
app = MyPingApp()
with Tracker(app) as tracker:
  # Change tracker and application configurations
  ...
  app.run()
```
````
`````

## Retrieving Data Flow Tracking Results

After an application has been run, data flow tracking results can be accessed by
various functions:

1. `print()` ({cpp:func}`C++ <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::print>`/{py:func}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowTracker.print>`)
   - Prints all data flow tracking results including end-to-end latencies and the number of
     source messages to the standard output.

2. `get_num_paths()` ({cpp:func}`C++ <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::get_num_paths>`/{py:func}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowTracker.get_num_paths>`)
   - Returns the number of paths between the root operators and the leaf operators.

3. `get_path_strings()` ({cpp:func}`C++ <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::get_path_strings>`/{py:func}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowTracker.get_path_strings>`)
   - Returns a vector of strings, where each string represents a path between the root operators
     and the leaf operators. A path is a comma-separated list of operator names.

4. `get_metric()` ({cpp:func}`C++ <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::get_metric>`/{py:func}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowTracker.get_metric>`)
   - Returns the value of different metrics based on the arguments.
   - `get_metric(std::string pathstring, holoscan::DataFlowMetric metric)` returns the value of a
     metric `metric` for a path `pathstring`. The metric can be one of the following:
        - `holoscan::DataFlowMetric::kMaxE2ELatency`
        ({py:const}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowMetric.MAX_E2E_LATENCY>`): the maximum end-to-end latency in the path.
        - `holoscan::DataFlowMetric::kAvgE2ELatency` ({py:const}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowMetric.AVG_E2E_LATENCY>`): the average end-to-end latency in the path.
        - `holoscan::DataFlowMetric::kMinE2ELatency` ({py:const}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowMetric.MIN_E2E_LATENCY>`): the minimum end-to-end latency in the path.
        - `holoscan::DataFlowMetric::kMaxMessageID` ({py:const}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowMetric.MAX_MESSAGE_ID>`): the message number or ID which resulted in the
          maximum end-to-end latency.
        - `holoscan::DataFlowMetric::kMinMessageID` ({py:const}`python <holoscan.core.DataFlowMetric.MIN_MESSAGE_ID>`): the message number or ID which resulted in the
          minimum end-to-end latency.
   - `get_metric(holoscan::DataFlowMetric metric = DataFlowMetric::kNumSrcMessages)` returns a map of source operator and its edge, and the number of messages sent from the source operator to the edge.

In the {ref}`above example <holoscan-enable-data-flow-tracking-cpp>`, the data flow tracking results can be printed to the standard output like the
following:

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} C++
```{code-block} cpp
:emphasize-lines: 6
:name: holoscan-enable-data-flow-tracking-results-cpp
auto app = holoscan::make_application<MyPingApp>();
auto& tracker = app->track(); // Enable Data Flow Tracking
// Change application configurations
...
app->run();
tracker.print();
```
````
````{tab-item} Python
```{code-block} python
:emphasize-lines: 6
:name: holoscan-one-operator-workflow-python
from holoscan.core import Tracker
...
app = MyPingApp()
with Tracker(app) as tracker:
  # Change tracker and application configurations
  ...
  app.run()
  tracker.print()
```
````
`````

## Customizing Data Flow Tracking

Data flow tracking can be customized using a few, optional configuration parameters. The `track()` method ({cpp:func}`C++ <holoscan::Fragment::track>`/{py:class}`Tracker class in python <holoscan.core.Tracker>`) can be configured to skip a few messages at the beginning of an application's execution as a *warm-up* period. It is also possible to discard a few messages at the end of an application's run as a *wrap-up* period. Additionally, outlier end-to-end latencies can be ignored by setting a latency threshold value which is the minimum latency below which the observed latencies are ignored.

:::{tip}
For effective benchmarking, it is common practice to include warm-up and cool-down periods by skipping the initial and final messages.
:::

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} C++
```{code-block} cpp
:caption: Optional parameters to `track()`
Fragment::track(uint64_t num_start_messages_to_skip = kDefaultNumStartMessagesToSkip,
                         uint64_t num_last_messages_to_discard = kDefaultNumLastMessagesToDiscard,
                         int latency_threshold = kDefaultLatencyThreshold);
```
````
````{tab-item} Python
```{code-block} python
:caption: Optional parameters to `Tracker`
Tracker(num_start_messages_to_skip=num_start_messages_to_skip,
            num_last_messages_to_discard=num_last_messages_to_discard,
            latency_threshold=latency_threshold)
```
````
`````
The default values of these parameters of `track()` are as follows:
- `kDefaultNumStartMessagesToSkip`: 10
- `kDefaultNumLastMessagesToDiscard`: 10
- `kDefaultLatencyThreshold`: 0 (do not filter out any latency values)

These parameters can also be configured using the helper functions:
{cpp:func}`set_skip_starting_messages <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::set_skip_starting_messages>`,
{cpp:func}`set_discard_last_messages <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::set_discard_last_messages>`
and {cpp:func}`set_skip_latencies <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::set_skip_latencies>`.

## Logging

The Data Flow Tracking API provides the ability to log every message's graph-traversal information to a file. This enables you to analyze the data flow at a granular level. When logging is enabled, every message's received and sent timestamps at every operator between the root and the leaf operators are logged after a message has been processed at the leaf operator.

The logging is enabled by calling the `enable_logging` method in {cpp:func}`C++ <holoscan::DataFlowTracker::enable_logging>` and by providing the `filename` parameter to `Tracker` in {py:class}`python <holoscan.core.Tracker>`.

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} C++
```{code-block} cpp
:emphasize-lines: 3
:name: holoscan-flow-tracking-logging-cpp
auto app = holoscan::make_application<MyPingApp>();
auto& tracker = app->track(); // Enable Data Flow Tracking
tracker.enable_logging("logging_file_name.log");
...
app->run();
```
````
````{tab-item} Python
```{code-block} python
:emphasize-lines: 2
:name: holoscan-flow-tracking-logging-python
from holoscan.core import Tracker
...
app = MyPingApp()
with Tracker(app, filename="logger.log") as tracker:
   ...
   app.run()
```
````
`````

The logger file logs the paths of the messages after a leaf operator has finished its `compute` method. Every path in the logfile includes an array of tuples of the form:

>"(root operator name, message receive timestamp, message publish timestamp) -> ... -> (leaf operator name, message receive timestamp, message publish timestamp)".

This log file can further be analyzed to understand latency distributions, bottlenecks, data flow, and other characteristics of an application.
