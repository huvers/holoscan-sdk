# Holoscan Application Package Specification (HAP)

<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=2 depthTo=3 orderedList=false} -->

## Introduction

The Holoscan Application Package specification extends the MONAI Deploy Application Package specification to provide the streaming capabilities, multi-fragment, and other features of the Holoscan SDK.

## Overview

This document includes the specification of the Holoscan Application Package (HAP). A HAP is a containerized application or service which is self-descriptive, as defined by this document.

### Goal

This document aims to define the structure and purpose of a HAP, including which parts are optional and which are required so that developers can easily create conformant HAPs.

### Assumptions, Constraints, Dependencies

The following assumptions relate to HAP execution, inspection and general usage:

-   Containerized applications will be based on Linux x64 (AMD64) and/or ARM64 (aarch64).

-   Containerized applications' host environment will be based on Linux x64 (AMD64) and/or ARM64 (aarch64) with container support.

-   Developers expect the local execution of their applications to behave identically to the execution of the containerized version.

-   Developers expect the local execution of their containerized applications to behave identically to the execution in deployment.

-   Developers and operations engineers want the application packages to be self-describing.

-   Applications may be created using tool other than that provided in the Holoscan SDK or the MONAI Deploy App SDK.

-   Holoscan Application Package may be created using a tool other than that provided in the Holoscan SDK or the MONAI Deploy App SDK.

-   Pre-existing, containerized applications must be "converted" into Holoscan Application Packages.

-   A Holoscan Application Package may contain a classical application (non-fragment based), a single-fragment application, or a multi-fragment application. (Please see the definition of fragment in [Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations](#definitions-acronyms-abbreviations))

-   The scalability of a multi-fragment application based on Holoscan SDK is outside the scope of this document.

-   Application packages are expected to be deployed in one of the supported environments. For additional information, see [Holoscan Operating Environments](#operating-environments).

## Architecture & Design

### Description

The Holoscan Application Package (HAP) is a functional package designed to act on datasets of a prescribed format. A HAP is a container image that adheres to the specification provided in this document.

### Application

The primary component of a HAP is the application. The application is provided by an application developer and incorporated into the HAP using the Holoscan Application Packager.

All application code and binaries SHALL be in the `/opt/holoscan/app/` folder, except for any dependencies installed by the Holoscan Application Packager during the creation of the HAP.

All AI models (PyTorch, TensorFlow, TensorRT, etc.) SHOULD be in separate sub-folders of the `/opt/holoscan/models/` folder. In specific use cases where the app package developer is prevented from enclosing the model files in the package/container due to intellectual property concerns, the models can be supplied from the host system when the app package is run, e.g., via the volume mount mappings and the use of container env variables.

### Manifests

A HAP SHALL contain two manifests: the Application Manifest and the Package Manifest. The Package Manifest shall be stored in `/etc/holoscan/pkg.json`, and the Application Manifest shall be stored in `/etc/holoscan/app.json`. Once a HAP is created, its manifests are expected to be immutable.

The Package Manifest file provides information about the HAP's package layout. It is not intended as a mechanism for controlling how the HAP is used or how the HAP's Application is executed.

-   The Package Manifest MUST be UTF-8 encoded and use the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

-   The Package Manifest SHOULD support either CRLF or LF style line endings.

-   The Package Manifest SHOULD specify the folder which contains the application (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#applicationRoot`).

    -   When not provided, the default path `/opt/holoscan/app/` will be assumed.

-   The Package Manifest SHOULD provide the version of the package file manifest schema (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#apiVersion`).

    -   The Manifest schema version SHALL be provided as a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) string.

-   The Package Manifest SHOULD provide the package version of itself (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#version`).

    -   The Package version SHALL be provided as a [semantic version](https://semver.org/) string.

-   The Package Manifest SHOULD provide the directory path to the user-provided models. (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#modelRoot`).

    -   The value provided must be an absolute path (the first character is `/`).

    -   When not provided, the default path `/opt/holoscan/models/` SHALL be assumed.

-   The Package Manifest SHOULD list the models used by the application (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#models`).

    -   Models SHALL be defined by name (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#models[*].name`).

        -   Model names SHALL NOT contain any Unicode whitespace or control characters.

        -   Model names SHALL NOT exceed 128 bytes in length.

    -   Models SHOULD provide a file-system path if they're included in the HAP itself (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#models[*].path`).

        -   When the value is a relative file-system path (the first character is not `/`), it is relative to the model root directory defined in `/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#modelRoot`.

        -   When the value is an absolute file-system path (the first character is `/`), the file-system path is used as-is.

        -   When no value is provided, the name is assumed as the name of the directory relative to the model root directory defined in `/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#modelRoot`.

-   The Package Manifest SHOULD specify the resources required to execute the Application and the fragments for a Multi-Fragment Application.

    This information is used to provision resources when running the containerized application using a compatible application deployment service.

-   A classic Application or a single Fragment Application SHALL define its resources in the `/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#resource` object.

    -   The `/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#resource` object is for the whole application. It CAN also be used as a catchall for all fragments in a multi-fragment application where applicable.

    -   CPU requirements SHALL be denoted using the decimal count of CPU cores (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#resources.cpu`).

    -   Optional CPU limits SHALL be denoted using the decimal count of CPU cores (`/etc/holoscan/pkg.json#resources.cpuLimit`)

## Supplemental Application Files

-   A HAP SHOULD package supplemental application files provided by the user.

    -   Supplemental files SHOULD be in sub-folders of the `/opt/holoscan/docs/` folder.

    -   Supplemental files include, but are not limited to, the following:

        -   README.md

        -   License.txt

        -   Changelog.txt

        -   EULA

        -   Documentation

        -   Third-party licenses

### Container Behavior and Interaction

A HAP is a single container supporting the following defined behaviors when started.

#### Default Behavior

When a HAP is started from the CLI or other means without any parameters, the HAP shall execute the contained application. The HAP internally may use `Entrypoint`, `CMD`, or a combination of both.

#### Manifest Export

A HAP SHOULD provide at least one method to access the _embedded application_, _models_, _licenses_, _README_, or _manifest files_, namely, `app.json` and `package.json`.

-   The Method SHOULD provide a container command, _`show`_, to print one or more manifest files to the console.

-   The Method SHOULD provide a container command, _`export`_, to copy one or more manifest files to a mounted volume path, as described below

    -   `/var/run/holoscan/export/app/`: when detected, the Method copies the contents of `/opt/holoscan/app/` to the folder.

    -   `/var/run/holoscan/export/config/`: when detected, the Method copies `/var/holoscan/app.yaml`, `/etc/holoscan/app.json` and `/etc/holoscan/pkg.json` to the folder.

    -   `/var/run/holoscan/export/models/`: when detected, the Method copies the contents of `/opt/holoscan/models/` to the folder.

    -   `/var/run/holoscan/export/docs/`: when detected, the Method copies the contents of `/opt/holoscan/docs/` to the folder.

    -   `/var/run/holoscan/export/`: when detected without any of the above being detected, the Method SHALL copy all of the above.

Since a HAP is an OCI compliant container, a user can also run a HAP and log in to an interactive shell, using a method supported by the container engine and its command line interface; e.g., Docker supports this by setting the entrypoint option. The files in the HAP can then be opened or copied to the mapped volumes with shell commands or scripts. A specific implementation of a HAP may choose to streamline such a process with scripts and applicable user documentation.
